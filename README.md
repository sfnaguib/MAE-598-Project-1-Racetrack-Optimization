# MAE-598-Project-1-Racetrack-Optimization
This project tasked us with optimizing a generalized dynamic system problem. For this, I wrote a Python code to optimize the path of a Formula 1 car around a circular track. This code optimizes the path itself as it travels at a constant speed around the track. It makes use of learning rates and loss functions.
